**23.10.2023 first day**

The Setup was done at ~12:00
we had to wait for the safety guy to show up until 16:00 tho

Problems with the MFC's occured in the beginning, after some time of no flow Error messages accumulated in the FlowDDE and the FlowView panels were not responding 
Maybe it was due to a loose contact at the USB-Hub
we changed it and the error did not comeback until now

LaB6 was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)
Si Nist standard was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)
empty Cap was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)
empty Cell with heatshield was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)

First in-situ experiment FMue_1 started 20:32:09
- Ramp 5° / min up to 450 °C
- Dwell time for 3h
- Ramp 10° / min up to 600 °C
- Dwell time for 30mins

***It was not possible to reach 600°C, we decided to just go from 450 to 350 and start the reduction***


Afterwards reducing at 350°C 

**Reduction at 350°C**

at 1:00 the calcination was over (scann number 534), we start the ramp untill 350°C and open the He flow.
He will be flushed for 15 minutes.
scann number 550 reach 350°C.
H2 start to flow with scann number 564.

The reduction is quite slow, the peaks around 2.9 and 4.25 &#8491;<sup>-1</sup> are changing after 1h of reaction.
After 2h of reduction only CoO is formed and the intensity of the peak at 2.9 &#8491;<sup>-1</sup> reached a plateu value. Nothing is changed for 1 and an half hour.

We decide to put 450°C. From scann 828 we are heating with a ramp of 10°C/min untill 450°C.
The idea is to see if we can detect the reduction of CoO to Co.

The temperature is reached at scann 847.
The peak at 3.5 &#8491;<sup>-1</sup> is increasing --> Co is forming.

The reaction is really slow, we can reduced the time of the first reduction, but the second step seems to be quite slow.

We have to decide how to proceed.
We can just do the entire reduction at 450°C and hope that we will see a two step process, otherwise we can just do a fast reduction at 350°C (around 1h) and go immediately to 450 for the second step.
In case we want to do the second way, it is probably usefull to decide which sample we really need to measure.
We can also think to calcine for lower time, from the data seems that the calcination is over avter 1.5h.

We start to flush He before stopping the measurement (scann 1103 time 5:44). Stop the temperature (scann 1106).


**FMue-2**
Started the measurement at 6:25.
The cells looked tight (He flow 32.5 ml/min, we tested also with the detector).
Set a ramo until 450°C for the calcination.
The thermocouple is not in the correct position. I stopped the mesurements
We start again the measurement by using a ramp of 10°C/min (time 8:17 folder: FMue_2_second_run)
Thermocouple doesnt recognize any Temperature
Cancelled at 08:32


**FMue-3**
Started the measurement at 8:52
nothing changed only the wire was a bit loose at the connecting luster terminal
