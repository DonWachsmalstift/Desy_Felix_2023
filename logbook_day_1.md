**23.10.2023 first day**

The Setup was done at ~12:00
we had to wait for the safety guy to show up until 16:00 tho

Problems with the MFC's occured in the beginning, after some time of no flow Error messages accumulated in the FlowDDE and the FlowView panels were not responding 
Maybe it was due to a loose contact at the USB-Hub
we changed it and the error did not comeback until now

LaB6 was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)
Si Nist standard was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)
empty Cap was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)
empty Cell with heatshield was measured for 5mins (5 images a 60s)

First in-situ experiment FMue_1 started 20:32:09
- Ramp 5° / min up to 450 °C
- Dwell time for 3h
- Ramp 10° / min up to 600 °C
- Dwell time for 30mins

***It was not possible to reach 600°C, we decided to just go from 450 to 350 and start the reduction***


Afterwards reducing at 350°C 

**Reduction at 350°C**

at 1:00 the calcination was over (scann number 534), we start the ramp untill 350°C and open the He flow.
He will be flushed for 15 minutes.
scann number 550 reach 350°C.
H2 start to flow with scann number 564.
