The Setup was done at ~12:00
we had to wait for the safety guy to show up until 16:00 tho

Problems with the MFC's occured in the beginning, after some time of no flow Error messages accumulated in the FlowDDE and the FlowView panels were not responding 
Maybe it was due to a loose contact at the USB-Hub
we changed it and the error did not comeback until now
