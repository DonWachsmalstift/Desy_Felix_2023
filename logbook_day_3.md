8:23 the air bottle was closed, we opened it again, but the He bottle was still open. 

** FMue-4
10:12 we noticed the temperature droppend because the timer was set to 3h and it was over so it wanted to cool down to 350
should have been picture ~590

10:56 (frame 685) plateau not really there, but changing from H2 to He and starting to heat up to 600°C with 20 °C per min.
11:00 500 °C were reached, but at full power, therefore we decided to stop the experiment at this point. Last frame is 698.

++ FMue-7
11:26 the capillarie was tight immidiatly, this fucking beamtime is a blessing
Synthetic Air flow is now stable again at ~3.5 ml/min after we reopened the bottle (what ever fucker closed it for us, we informed Hendrik and he will clean the ass of whoever it was)
He flow is also stable again evnetho we didnt change anything

We decided to skip FMue-5 and -6 for now and check if we can run them on the last day because of SBa90 shitty support

Y-Position checked and its still fine
Measurement started at 11:29
Heating to 450 °C with 5°/min
Air flow of 3.5 ml/min
