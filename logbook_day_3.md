8:23 the air bottle was closed, we opened it again, but the He bottle was still open. 

** FMue-4
10:12 we noticed the temperature droppend because the timer was set to 3h and it was over so it wanted to cool down to 350
should have been picture ~590

10:56 (frame 685) plateau not really there, but changing from H2 to He and starting to heat up to 600°C with 20 °C per min.
11:00 500 °C were reached, but at full power, therefore we decided to stop the experiment at this point. Last frame is 698.

++ FMue-7
11:26 the capillarie was tight immidiatly, this fucking beamtime is a blessing
Synthetic Air flow is now stable again at ~3.5 ml/min after we reopened the bottle (what ever fucker closed it for us, we informed Hendrik and he will clean the ass of whoever it was)
He flow is also stable again evnetho we didnt change anything

We decided to skip FMue-5 and -6 for now and check if we can run them on the last day because of SBa90 shitty support

Y-Position checked and its still fine
Measurement started at 11:29
Heating to 450 °C with 5°/min
Air flow of 3.5 ml/min

reached 450°C at 12:53

at 13:59 (frame 300) we started to coole down to 350 °C in 20°C per min. and turned the He (34 ml/min) on (frame 301). 
we reached 350°C at   14:04 (frame 309). 
we started the H at 14:14 (frame 329) ca. 8 ml/min
14.45 (image 390) Beamdump, we started He flushing as soon as we noticed and leave temperature and measurements going
15:16 (image 454) Beam is BACKBABY but Ion chamber is not completly back (so lower intensity in images)
15:31 (image 484) we put on hydrogen again and check if the images look like befor
15:38 (image 499) we put He on and start heating to 450 (20°/min), peak positions are all the same shouldnt have hapenned anything in the sample during beamdump
15:45 we are at 450 °C and turn on H2 flow 8 ml/min (image 513)

When we normalize the Y values (Intensities) the kinetics look a bit smoother
we need to do this since the beam had lost intensity after the beamdump and the diagram looks like someone did not wash his ass today
