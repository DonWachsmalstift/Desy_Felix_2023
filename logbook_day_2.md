Just started FMue-2 third run and opened a new Logbook for the second day + night shift

**FMue-2**
Started the measurement at 8:52
nothing changed only the wire was a bit loose at the connecting luster terminal

10:35 starting cooling down to 350 Â°C
350 reached at 10:53 (frame 242), then starting flushing with He for 15 minutes 
integration of the measured sample shoed a really high backround. We stopped the measurement and decided to move the collimator closer to the sample and also the beam stop to around 15 cm (beamstop-sample distance) to still get a Qmin of hopefully around 0.4.
