Just started FMue-2 third run and opened a new Logbook for the second day + night shift

**FMue-2**
Started the measurement at 8:52
nothing changed only the wire was a bit loose at the connecting luster terminal

10:35 starting cooling down to 350 째C
350 reached at 10:53 (frame 242), then starting flushing with He for 15 minutes 
integration of the measured sample shoed a really high backround. We stopped the measurement and decided to move the collimator closer to the sample and also the beam stop to around 15 cm (beamstop-sample distance) to still get a Qmin of hopefully around 0.4. 

new test measurement looks better, we got less underground (less airscattering id assume)
we didnt change anything about the sample detector distance and stuff so in general it should all work with the same poni file
we still moved all the measured stuff into an "old_setup" folder and will now put all new measurements in the raw folder

###
12:09 we started again to heat FMue-2 to 350 with He flow
12:55 starting pure hydrogen flow 7.5 ml/min
13:18 we do not see any obvious changes anymore in the xrd gonna wait for 10 more minutes
13:42 nothing is changing anylonger
gonna heat up to 450 째C (10째 / min) with He flow and go on with reduction
13:03 450째C reached, switching to H2 flow 7.5 ml/min, image 227
