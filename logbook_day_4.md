the dayshift arrived !!!!!!!!!!!

**proceeding FMue_10**

9:00 450°C are reached at frame 170.
Calcination seems done after 1h

10:23 He flushing and Ramp to 350°C with 10°/min started

10:40 H2 flushig started image (369) 8 ml/min

11:16 Reduction was pretty much over immidiately like for the other samples
we gonna flush with He and go up to 450 °C with 10°/min (image 446)

11:35 we start H2 8 ml/min (image 480)

12:49 the reductions seems nearly done, way faster then for other samples

13:07 we started He flushing because we reached the plateu

13:08 we stop the measurement


**SB**
Test at 13:22
we have full flow of He even though the powder is very fine grained and was not sieved
Temperature File for all Supports is called Alox

13:25 we start measurement and heatramp to 450 °C 5°/min Airflow of 3 ml/min

14:49 450°C reached, xrd looks like gamma alumina
gonna wait for 60 mins and then go up to T max. 
15:49 measurement stopped

**SBa200**
16:05 measurement started with Air Heatramp 20°/min to 450
16:27 stopped

**TH100/150**
16:54 measurement started with Air Heatramp 20°/min to 450
17:15 stopped

**SBa150**
17:26 measurement started with Air Heatramp 20°/min to 450
17:48 stopped

**SBa90**
17:59 measurement started with Air Heatramp 20°/min to 450
18:22 stopped

**MNZ-22**
18:38 measurement started with Airflow 3 ml/min heatramp to 450 °C 5°/min.
20:02 reached 450 °C.
Start to flush He at 22:04 scann 412.
Start H2 at 22:19 scann 441.
Start to flush He at 00:37 scann 717.

**FMue 1 new**
Start measurement at 1:12, we have to hurry up so the ramp to 450°C is set to be 10°C/min.
We had to stop immidiately because the temperatrure did not increase.
Problem in the connection of the wires, we fixed it but the capillary was broken.

**FMue 2 calcination**
Start at 1:45.
Reach 450°C at scann 169 (3:11)
Calcination seems to be finish at 4:12 (scann 293)

**FMue 1 new**
Start measurement at 4:30, we have to hurry up so the ramp to 450°C is set to be 10°C/min.
450°C reach at scann 83 (time 5:12).
