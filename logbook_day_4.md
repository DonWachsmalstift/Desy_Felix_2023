the dayshift arrived !!!!!!!!!!!

**proceeding FMue_10**

9:00 450°C are reached at frame 170.
Calcination seems done after 1h

10:23 He flushing and Ramp to 350°C with 10°/min started

10:40 H2 flushig started image (369) 8 ml/min

11:16 Reduction was pretty much over immidiately like for the other samples
we gonna flush with He and go up to 450 °C with 10°/min (image 446)

11:35 we start H2 8 ml/min (image 480)

12:49 the reductions seems nearly done, way faster then for other samples

13:07 we started He flushing because we reached the plateu

13:08 we stop the measurement


**SB**
Test at 13:22
we have full flow of He even though the powder is very fine grained and was not sieved
Temperature File for all Supports is called Alox

13:25 we start measurement and heatramp to 450 °C 5°/min Airflow of 3 ml/min

14:49 450°C reached, xrd looks like gamma alumina
gonna wait for a bit and then go up to T max.
